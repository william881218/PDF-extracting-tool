## PDF extractor

### Usage
My friend has a large number of PDFs, which saves lots of customer's data.
He wants me to help him extracting these data into a csv file.
Well, since it a tiny tiny project, it only works for my friends' PDF file.
(same format as ```test.pdf```. You can take a look at it to understand the format.)

### How to use
Remember to install pdfplumber module.
Just type ```python3 pdf_extracting_tool.py [-filename]``` in terminal.
